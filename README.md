# django_tdd_docker


This project is a part of the course: https://testdriven.io/courses/tdd-django/. 

My achievements: 

- Django app with several endpoints and tests. 
- docker compose starts two containers. First one with my Django app. Second with Postres. 
- Project was deployed to Heroku: https://whispering-fortress-58832.herokuapp.com/api/movies/, https://whispering-fortress-58832.herokuapp.com/api/movies/2/, ...
- CI with two stages was added: build and tests. First stages passes second one fails. All tests passes locally. I'm not going to solve this issue.
